## Vendor Library Setup (STM32CubeF4)

This project uses the STM32CubeF4 library from ST as a submodule.
To keep the repository small, we only track symlinks to the headers we actually use.

### Initial Setup

After cloning the repository for the first time, run the following script to fetch the library and initialize its submodules:

_scripts/init_submodules.sh_

```

```
